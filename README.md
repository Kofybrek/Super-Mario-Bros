# Super-Mario-Bros
Remake of the original Super Mario Bros game.

Here's the video explaining how I did it: https://youtu.be/7D4uoSoQsjw

## Compile and RUN

You need cmake, sfml, g++, etc... so install them if don't have.

Clone it from repo, e.g.:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Kofybrek/Super-Mario-Bros.git 
```

Compile and run:


```bash
$ cd Super-Mario-Bros
$ cmake -B build
$ make -C build
$ build/SuperMario
```

And have fun!
