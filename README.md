# Super-Mario-Bros
Remake of the original Super Mario Bros game.

Here's the video explaining how I did it: https://youtu.be/7D4uoSoQsjw

### Game buttons

1. Arrow keys, up, down, left, and right.
2. `Z`: Can replace the arrow keys to achieve jump.
3. `Esc` to exit the game.
4. `Enter` to reset the game.
5. `Space` parkour mode, automatic forward or backward, controlled by the arrow keys. Press again to cancel.
